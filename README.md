# AI-Powered Road Encroachment Detection (Proof of Concept)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **proof of concept (PoC)** for an **AI-powered road surveillance system** that detects and reports public land encroachment by private entities.  
The system simulates drone-based aerial monitoring using sample datasets (images/videos) to identify unauthorized constructions, road blockages, or land use violations.

The solution demonstrates how computer vision and AI can assist **urban planning authorities, municipal corporations, and enforcement agencies** in automating surveillance and maintaining public infrastructure integrity.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dataset Simulation**: Uses aerial/satellite image datasets to mimic drone surveillance.
- **Encroachment Detection Model**: Employs CNN-based object detection/segmentation to identify anomalies like unauthorized structures or road obstructions.
- **Violation Mapping**: Outputs detection results with bounding boxes and heatmaps.
- **Automated Reporting (PoC)**: Generates alerts/reports summarizing detected encroachments.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
1. **Data Input**: Pre-collected aerial/drone images or sample datasets.
2. **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
3. **Model**: Deep learning model (e.g., Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or UNet for segmentation).
4. **Detection & Analysis**: Identify regions of potential encroachment.
5. **Output**: Annotated images + structured report.
